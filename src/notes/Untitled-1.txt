1. Add a new entity "Invoice" (счет) to the system:
   - Define the structure of the invoice, including tables for items, totals, and metadata.
   - Include a list of associated bookings (брони) in the invoice.

2. Replace the "Print Invoice" button with a "Create Invoice" button:
   - Update the UI for bookings to include the "Create Invoice" button.
   - Ensure that clicking this button creates a new invoice and associates the current booking with it.

3. Implement the invoice interface:
   - Display all tables currently present in the invoice.
   - Add a "Print" button for printing the invoice.
   - Include save functionality for the invoice.

4. Add a list of bookings to the invoice interface:
   - Display the list of bookings associated with the invoice at the top of the interface.
   - Allow multiple bookings to be included in a single invoice.

5. Ensure proper linkage between bookings and invoices:
   - When creating an invoice from a booking, automatically add the booking to the invoice's list.
   - Update the database or data model to reflect this relationship.
